# Webpack 5
 *At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.*
## Webpack 5 ralease
*Webpack 4 was released in February 2018. Since then we shipped a lot of features without breaking changes. We know that people dislike major changes with breaking changes. Especially with webpack, which people usually only touch twice a year, and the remaining time it "just works". But shipping features without breaking changes also has a cost: We can't do major API or architectural improvements.*

*So from time to time, there is a point where the difficulties pile up and we are forced to do breaking changes to not mess everything up. That's the time for a new major version. So webpack 5 contains these architectural improvements and the features that were not possible to implement without them.*

*The major version was also the chance to revise some of the defaults and to align with proposals and specifications that come up in the meantime.*

*So today (2020-10-10) webpack 5.0.0 is released, but this doesn't mean it's done, bugfree or even feature-complete. As with webpack 4 we continue development by fixing problems and adding features. In the next days there will probably be a lot bugfixes. Features will come later.*
